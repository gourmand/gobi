## Steps to use a custom configuration in Gobi

Once you've found the configuration you want to use on Gobi Hub:

1. Click “Add Config” on its page
2. Add any required inputs (e.g. secrets like API keys)

After saving, open the Gobi CLI or IDE extension and

- Select the configuration from the **config dropdown** in the Gobi extension
- Type `/config` and select the configuration in the Gobi CLI
- Begin using it for chat mode, agent mode, or other configured capabilities.
